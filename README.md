# YOLOv5 Real-Time Object Detection

## Project Description
This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 deep learning model and OpenCV in Python. The model detects multiple common objects such as people, cars, and other everyday items using your computerâ€™s webcam feed. It can be used in various applications including assisting blind people, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and research.

## Features
- Real-time object detection from webcam feed.
- Uses pre-trained YOLOv5s model from Ultralytics.
- Simple integration with OpenCV for video capture and display.
- Annotates detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Numpy (for array handling)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy
Run the detection script:

bash
python Detect.py

python Detect.py
Press 'q' to quit the webcam window.

Scope
1. Assistive technologies for visually impaired users.
2. Enhancing driver safety with ADAS.
3. Academic and industrial research.

Limitations
Detection accuracy depends on camera quality.
Performance affected by system hardware.
Model can sometimes misclassify objects.

Challenges
Compatibility across Python versions.
Managing updates to YOLOv5 and its dependencies.
Library version conflicts and updates.
